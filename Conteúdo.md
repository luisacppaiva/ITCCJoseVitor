## Lógica da imagem 
- In reading written lines, we are following "historically” given ==points== (concepts). In reading ﬁlms, we are following “historically” given surfaces (images).
- **Images:** But this situation will change in the very near future. It is even now technically possible to project ﬁlms and TV programs that allow the reader to control and manipulate the sequence of the pictures, and to super impose other pictures upon them. Videoscopes and multimedia shows point clearly to this possibility. In consequence, the “history” of a ﬁlm will be something that is partly devised or manipulated by the reader. It will even become partially reversible.

## Lógica da estrutura 
- Western epistemology is based on the Cartesian premise that to think means to follow the written line, and it does not give the photograph its due as a way of thinking. Let us therefore try to forget that, ==according to our school’s tradition, to adequate thought to thing means to adequate concept to extension (point to body)==. The whole problem of truth and falsehood, of ﬁction and reality, must now be reformulated in the light of the mass media if we are to avoid the barrenness of academicism.
### Mídia de massas 
We live in an expanding universe: the media offer us more and more things of which we can have no immediate experience, ==and take away, one by one, the things with which we can communicate directly.== O que está sendo tirado? 
## Utopia da imagem 
- This would lead to new types of communication in which man consciously assumes the structural position. Science would then be no longer merely discursive and conceptual, but would have recourse to imaginal models. Art would no longer work at things (“oeuvres”), but would propose models. Politics would no longer ﬁght for the realizations of values, but would elaborate manipulable hierarchies of models of behavior. All this would mean, in short, that a new sense of reality would articulate itself, within the existential climate of a new religiosity.
