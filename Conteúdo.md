## Lógica da imagem 
- In reading written lines, we are following "historically” given ==points== (concepts). In reading ﬁlms, we are following “historically” given surfaces (images).
- **Images:** But this situation will change in the very near future. It is even now technically possible to project ﬁlms and TV programs that allow the reader to control and manipulate the sequence of the pictures, and to super impose other pictures upon them. Videoscopes and multimedia shows point clearly to this possibility. In consequence, the “history” of a ﬁlm will be something that is partly devised or manipulated by the reader. It will even become partially reversible.

## Lógica da estrutura 
- Western epistemology is based on the Cartesian premise that to think means to follow the written line, and it does not give the photograph its due as a way of thinking. Let us therefore try to forget that, ==according to our school’s tradition, to adequate thought to thing means to adequate concept to extension (point to body)==. The whole problem of truth and falsehood, of ﬁction and reality, must now be reformulated in the light of the mass media if we are to avoid the barrenness of academicism.
### Mídia de massas 
We live in an expanding uni-verse:the media offer us more and more things ofwhich we can have noimmediate experience,and take away,one by one,the things with whichwe can communicate directly.
